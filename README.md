# react_styled
Created with CodeSandbox

My Simple React app learning with styleed-components party library

## Installing
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https:https://github.com/AchmadWahyu/react_styled
```

## 2. Install dependencies, this can take a minute
```
cd react_styled
npm install
```

## 3. Start the local server

Your browser should now open and show the app. Otherwise open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. Editing files will automatically refresh the page.
